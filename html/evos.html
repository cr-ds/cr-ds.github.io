                            <h4>Evolution Cards</h4>
                            <p>
                              Card evolutions allow certain cards to become stronger versions of themselves after a certain
                               number of cycles. Each card with an evolution requires 6 evolution shards or joker shards to
                                use in battle. When an evolution card is deployed, a special deployment tone sounds while
                                 a purple light temporarily shines down on it.  All card evolutions have a special ability
                                  that the original card does not have. In addition to the ability, some card evolutions 
                                  have increased stats to compensate for their low use in combat. The number of cycles 
                                  indicates how many times the original card must be in hand to receive card evolution.
                                   For example, if a card takes two cycles to evolve, every third card is a card evolution.
                                    This is easy to track because once the card is inserted, a diamond will fill in over
                                     the card image the next time a player has it in their hand. Card evolution and the 
                                     first evolution slot is unlocked at king level 7. The second evolution slot is
                                      unlocked at king level 54. 
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <h4>Derivation</h4>
                              <p>
                              To keep Clash Royale varied and lively, Supercell releases a new development map every month.
                               This is made available exclusively in the 'Pass Royale'. The Pass Royale can be purchased 
                               for â‚¬14.99 and, in addition to the new evolution card (6 shards to unlock), also contains
                               other rewards such as chests, card jokers, cosmetic items, gold and jewels. Since the new 
                               development cards can only be obtained through passes and therefore real money, the question 
                               arises as to whether current card developments influence the meta and whether buying these 
                               passes is worthwhile and necessary in order to be able to play and keep up with the top
                                German clans. Purchasing the passes represents the use of the current evolution card and 
                                its upgrade. To answer this question, we examined all players' cards to unlock the evolution
                                 cards. Based on the history of the publication of evolution cards, exact conclusions could
                                  be drawn as to which evolution cards could only be unlocked with real money. Both the
                                   number of evolutions unlocked in total and the respective evolution card identify a
                                    player as a buyer or free player. 
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <h4>Card Level</h4>
                              <p>
                              There are five different card rarities in Clash Royale. Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary and
                              Champion cards. The levels of the cards determine their strength in the game. The rarity
                               of a card affects how many copies must be collected to reach the next level. When a card 
                               is upgraded to a higher level, its stats such as damage, hit points, or attack speed are 
                               improved. For hit points and damage, this is always +10%. Players can upgrade cards by 
                               collecting cards of the same type and using gold that can be earned or purchased in-game.
                                The higher the level of a card, the more effective it is in battle, but the more gold 
                                and cards are required for the next level.
                              </p>
                              <br>
                              <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
                              <p>
                              Due to limited evolution card slots, a maximum of two evolution cards can be used in a 
                              combat deck. As a first evaluation, we examined the relevance of the evolution cards to
                               find out which of these cards are profitable and how often they are actually used. To
                                do this, we carried out a statistical analysis of all battles won and lost and determined 
                                which evolution cards were played and won. The frequency of use (size of the circles) 
                                and chance of victory (height of the Y-axis) is shown in the graph below. In last place are the 
                                purchase-linked evolution cards Tesla, Valkyrie, Wallbreaker, Zap and Bomber with the 
                                lowest chances of victory and mediocre usage. The Knight and Firecracker have the largest
                                 shares, although neither have the highest win rates. Particularly striking is the Ice Spirit
                                  which, as a purchase-linked evolution card, has the second highest win rate and at the
                                   same time the lowest usage of all cards. This shows the targeted use of purchase-linked 
                                   evolution cards in the top player segment.
                              </p>

                          <p>
                              In connection with the research question of whether it 
                              is necessary to buy cards to stay in the high elo, there was an overlap in the
                               questions. This was analyzed in the graphic . This graph shows the proportion of
                                evolution cards at level 15 relative to the remaining cards at level 15 on average. 
                                Players have an average of 3.5 level 15 evolution cards per player and 16.5 cards 
                                at the maximum level 15. It should be emphasized that these are only average values 
                                and reference should be made to the analysis of the level 15 cards, which will be
                                 answered in <a href="level.html">the next research question</a>. The obvious proportion of
                                  evolution cards in use is made visually clear again by the graphic. Since only 
                                  25% of the eight deck cards can be evolutions due to the limited evolution card
                                   slots (maximum 2), players will need 6 additional cards in their maximum level 
                                   combat deck to be competitive. </p>

                        <h4>The most played Level 15 Evolutions</h4>  
                        <p>
                            For the analysis, all player card sets were searched and statistically determined 
                            how often which evolution cards were unlocked and at what level the evolution cards are.
                            The cards were divided into blue and yellow columns by color. Blue columns are card 
                             evolutions that can be unlocked without money by collecting fragments and events, yellow 
                             columns show the development cards from the Royal Passes that can only be purchased with money. 
                             The percentage of all unlocked evolutions is entered in the columns, which indicates how 
                             often an unlocked evolution was also brought to the maximum level of 15. Using a card at 
                             maximum level correlates strongly with regular use in top league battles. The battles there
                              can be played with the highest possible card level that players have unlocked. The percentage
                               therefore indirectly shows the active use and thus the relevance of the evolution cards 
                               at level 15. The evaluation shows that purchase-linked evolutions have the lowest proportion
                                of unlocked evolutions and also take up the lowest proportion of level 15 evolution cards.
                                 Nevertheless, there are strong cards among them, for example the Wall Breaker card, which 
                                 was only unlocked a little, but was brought to the maximum level by 68.5% of players. 
                                 The example shows that players may have specifically unlocked cards through purchases 
                                 and also use them in the active game.</p>

                              <p style="margin-top: 13%;">The evaluation of the unlocked evolutions led to the question of whether the evolution cards with the highest 
                                win rate were also the cards that players brought to the maximum level of 15 in order to maximize the usefulness 
                                of the evolution cards. We show this evaluation in this graphic. You can clearly see the small proportion of 
                                evolution cards that are tied to purchase (yellow) in contrast to the evolution cards that are freely available 
                                (blue). The Ice Spirit has the second highest win rate, but among the level 15 evolutions it appears in third-to-last 
                                place with just 2.46%. This shows a distortion of the data due to the analysis of top players, so that individual cards 
                                can be very strong (win rate), but at the same time are played very rarely (targeted use). A similar phenomenon occurs, 
                                for example, when using Wall Breakers. </p>
