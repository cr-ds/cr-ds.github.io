                            <h4>Number of Buildings</h4>
                            <p>
                              There are different types of cards in Clash Royale. One of these card types is buildings. 
                              Buildings are cards that can be placed in a stationary position on the playing field and perform defense 
                              or offense actions depending on the card. When building a deck, the player is not limited to the number of
                              buildings in the deck. It is therefore possible to build a deck without buildings, but also with one, 
                              two or three buildings. It is therefore interesting to know whether there is an influence of the number 
                              of buildings on the win rate and what influence this has.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                              To answer this question, we have presented an overview of the win rate in relation to the number of buildings 
                              used for all decks with at least 10 battles in the following violin plot. We have filtered for at least 10 battles here, 
                              as we did not want to include one-off outliers that were tested for fun in the analysis. The violin plot shows that 
                              decks with one building have the best median win rate of 60.71%. Decks with three buildings, on the other hand, perform 
                              the worst with a median win rate of 35.71%. Decks with no or two buildings have a median win rate of 58.33% and 56.04% 
                              respectively. The filter also shows that in a serious number of games there are no decks that use more than three buildings.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                              Based on these results, it can be said that the number of buildings is definitely relevant for the win rate. 
                              However, this relevance is not particularly high.
                            </p>

                          <h4>Specific Buildings</h4>
                            <p>
                              As previously mentioned, there are also more precise distinctions to consider when it comes to buildings. 
                              We distinguish between siege towers, defensive buildings and spawner buildings. A siege tower is a building 
                              that actively attacks the enemy's towers. A spawner building is a building that places troop units on the playing 
                              field at certain time intervals and a defensive building is a building that is used to defend your own towers.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                              In the following Sunburst graphic, we show the individual buildings depending on their building type. 
                              The size of the building segment in the graphic depends on the battles played with it. We use a color scale 
                              to show the win rate with this building. Both the number of battles and the win rate can also be displayed by 
                              hovering over the building. By selecting a building type, the view can be changed so that only the buildings of 
                              this type are displayed. Furthermore, we offer the option of filtering the view to the evaluations of decks with one, 
                              two or three buildings.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                              For example, if we look at the graph for decks with one building, i.e. the number of buildings with the highest win rate, 
                              we can see that the Tesla is played the most and has a win rate of 56.17%. The Bomb Tower, on the other hand, has almost 
                              20,000 fewer battles in the evaluation, but has a win rate of 60.04%. So it's not just the number of buildings in decks 
                              that matters, but also the specific buildings themselves.
