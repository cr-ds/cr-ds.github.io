                            <h4>Card Level</h4>
                            <p>There are five different card rarities in Clash Royale. Common, Rare,
                               Epic, Legendary and Champion cards. The levels of the cards determine 
                               their strength in the game. The rarity of a card affects how many cards
                                must be collected to reach the next level. When a card is upgraded 
                                to a higher level, its stats such as damage, hit points, or attack 
                                speed are improved. For hit points and damage this is always +10%.
                                 Players can upgrade cards by collecting cards of the same type and
                                  using gold that can be earned or purchased in-game. The higher the 
                                  level of a card, the more effective it is in battle, but the more
                                   gold and cards are required for the next level. Since June 12,
                                    2023, the maximum level for cards has been increased to 15. 
                                    To bring cards to level 15, 50.000 Elite Joker are required 
                                    per card. Elite Joker are obtained instead of cards for
                                     level 14 cards, as Path of Legends reward, from the Shop and from magic 
                                     items. We calculated that if you get the maximum number of 
                                     Elite Jokers in the game every month, eight cards per account 
                                     could be upgraded to level 15 for free by March without having
                                      to spend any real money. 50.000 Elite Jokers cost €7.99 in
                                      the shop. Since the battles of the top players at the
                                       highest ranking level and world ranking level require
                                        cards at level 15, we asked ourselves whether it is 
                                        necessary to buy level 15 cards and how many cards
                                        top players have at the maximum level and how much
                                         money was spent to achieve this to reach.  
                              </p>
                            <br>
                            <h4>Tower Troops</h4>
                            <p> Tower troops have been added to the game since December 12, 2023.
                               In addition to the previous Tower Princess, a card called Cannoneer was 
                               unlocked from this point on. Since then, this card has only been 
                               able to be improved through randomly found chests or with real money
                                in the shop. A clear indication for buying players is a level 14 
                                or even level 15 Cannoneer card. 
                             </p>
                             <br>
                             <h4>Data Anylsis</h4>
                             <p>For analysis, all player card sets were searched and statistically
                               determined how many and which cards were brought to level 15. 
                               Including the tower troop cards. Furthermore, the data set of all 
                               battles was used to determine whether and what victory rate the 
                               Cannoneer tower troop card had across all battles. Finally, the players were 
                               classified based on the number of level 15 cards they had and the real
                                money amount for the in-app purchases was determined. The sorted data 
                                shows the following:

                        <h4>Cannoneer</h4>  
                        <p>The Cannoneer was only purchased by 5% of players at level 15.
                             On the one hand, this may be due to the high real money price 
                             (€6.99 for 50 cards, as of March 15th). On the other hand, its 
                             win rate is not significantly higher than with the Princess card.
                              The Cannoneer is special and not easy to play. Even his share of 
                              fights is only 10% of all fights. In a direct comparison to the 
                              (only) other tower troop, the advantage of the (purchased) Cannoneer 
                              is not apparent.

                        <h4>The 20 most outleveled Cards</h4>  
                        <p> As already mentioned in the section on <a href="evos.html">evolutions</a>, 
                          the importance of level 15 evolutions as dominant level 15 cards is evident.
                            Important and frequently played win conditions (e.g. Hog Rider, The Log) were 
                             purchased at level 15. The buy-based evolutions 
                             (orange columns) from the previous chapter hardly 
                             differ from the other cards. The pattern of the data 
                             confirms that its relevance is no greater than that of other cards

                        <h4>Amount of Level 15 Cards and Money spend</h4>
                          <p>The results of the data analysis can be divided into four categories.
                             First category players, who have not bought any cards and only have 0 to 8 level 15
                              cards. Second category players who have bought a level 15 card “every now and then”,
                               i.e. have 9 to 12 level 15 cards. The third category includes clearly buying players with 13 to 
                               16 level 15 cards. These players have twice as many cards as have
                                been available for free since June 2023. And the final player category 
                                includes all paying players with more than 16 level 15 cards. 
                                The data shows that the proportion of players who have not necessarily
                                spent money (0 to 8 cards) and players who have definitely spent 
                                money (16 or more) are almost equal at 30% of players. The buy-based 
                                victory through level 15 cards can be completely refuted by this analysis. 
                                The 30% proportion of players with 8 or fewer level 15 cards shows that 
                                playing in the top 200 clans does not require level 15 cards.

                        <h4>Summary</h4>
                          <p>The following graphic provides an overview of the various purchase-related 
                            categories and the corresponding number of players who belong to the categories.
                            Even if many players in the individual categories (level 15 cannoneer, purchased 
                            level 15 cards) did not necessarily buy, it turns out that the binary breakdown 
                            of buying and non-buying players gives a different impression. Almost 80% of all
                             players have invested in one of the purchase-linked improvements. Only 
                             around 20% of top players have never purchased anything in the game.
